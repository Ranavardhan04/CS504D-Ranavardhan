I have created the contact book bu using the six functions and added the contacts with one function.
And added the functions for viewing the contact book and if we want to search for a contact we can search by its name.
After adding the contacts in the program it will directly save into the text file and when we exit the program and re-run it and after starting the program we need to call the function loading file and it will directly load the contacts from the file and execute it .
and then we can execute it directly by the help of text file.
it was a good program and learned how to use functions and handle exceptions and switch cases.
